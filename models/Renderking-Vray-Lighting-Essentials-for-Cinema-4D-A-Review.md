You can also animate the camera and the placeholders to create stunning motion graphics and animations.
 
The plug-in is compatible with Cinema 4D versions from R12 to R17. It requires V-Ray for Cinema 4D version 1.9 or higher. You can download the plug-in from Renderking's website[^1^] or from Toolfarm[^2^]. The plug-in comes as a zip file that contains the scenes and the documentation.

You can also customize the scene further by using the provided controls in the Attributes Manager. Each scene has its own set of parameters that let you change various aspects of the lighting, HDRI map, floor, background, color scheme, etc. For example, in the Absolute White scene, you can switch between an infinite or a regular floor, adjust the floor reflection and roughness, change the color or gradient of the background, and more.
 
If you want to animate your scene, you can use the built-in camera and placeholder animators that come with some of the scenes. For example, in the Motion Graphic scene, you can choose from four different studio presets and two different placeholder presets that have predefined animations. You can also modify the animation speed, duration, easing, etc. Alternatively, you can create your own animations using keyframes or splines.
